              <p class="articles">
                Chee-Yun’s magnificent violin was made in 1669 by Francesco Ruggieri. At the time, the
                northern Italian city of Cremona bustled and thrived in the art of string instrument-making.
                Luthiers such as Ruggieri and Antonio Stradivari were very much influenced by the
                craftsmanship of Nicolo Amati, who at that time was regarded as the star genius of Cremona.
                According to Tarisio, Ruggieri was influenced by Amati’s works as seen in his violins from 1670
                to 1680’s – considered to be Ruggieri’s golden period of his career.
              </p>

              <p class="articles">
                During her sophomore year at Juilliard, the then 21-year-old Chee-Yun’s ever-growing
                concert schedule put her in search of an instrument on which she could concertize. Chee-Yun
                gravitated towards a Ruggieri from Chicago’s famed Bein &amp; Fushi. Before purchasing the violin,
                Chee-Yun had the instrument appraised by the renowned antique violin appraiser and expert,
                Dario D’Attili, who was astounded by the extreme preserved state of the violin- the original
                varnish was still intact, no cracks or any sign of wear and tear.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-lg-6">
              <p class="articles">
                Not much was known of the
                violin’s provenance other than an account from Peter Biddulph, a British violin dealer from
                whom Bein &amp; Fushi purchased the violin. It belonged to a family in Norway for nearly a century,
                according to Biddulph.

                    열린 코리아타임즈 경연대회에서 그랑프리를 수상했고 13세에 미국 줄리어드에 입학하며 도미한 그녀는 어린 나이에 공식적인 연주활동을 시작하며 지금까지 화려한 솔리스트로서의 커리어를
